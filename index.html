    <div class="poem-title">The Grandfather Clock — Explained</div>

<p>The pendulum was swinging strong,
This is representative of a strong society that It's flourishing and has strong rhythm
Maintained by a meticulous viewer.
People in this society Focused on the common good and not their own puritan Interests
Things that needed change were tweaked;
Problems that did arise in society were handled in prudent way That aligns with the moral orders
This viewer used the same methods.
Ritual and tradition that society had representing a sense of peace in that you know how things would be handled Also in justice To establish how to protect and preserve societ
They rarely were ever altered.
The beliefs and practices of society are upheld and are not rapid to change or advancement</p>

<p>The hands ticked loud and clear,
Representative of the flourishing of society and the Prudence of the Collective society
The pendulum swung with steady force,
Representing stability in society As Its ways are still in line with order reality and virtue
The wood polished firmly bright,
The strong appearance of the societies beliefs and Values are on display
The clock, by its maintenance, continued.
Representative of the maintenance of institutions and Attentiveness And Action and communication in this society
It showed no signs of decay.
Society appears secure, strong, united, and unbroken</p>

<p>The clock held firm
Institutions remain resilient, standing tall against challenges because of collective attention and shared responsibility.
Under the eye of many viewers.
The strength of society comes from many people watching over it Of course those people living in it
But then came a few—
A small group begins to neglect their obligations to their families to society and their responsibilities
They began to turn their eye,
These individuals divert their attention, no longer watching over society’s well-being or its stability.
Looking at their watches.
Acting in a selfish way hyper individualistic only caring for their own self and autonomous ends</p>

<p>Slowly the pendulum stopped,
Without attention to the moral lawyer what is right and just order of kind of good Only focusing on your puritan interests society as we know it will come to a screeching halt
The hands had begun to falter,
Without attention the mechanisms of order begin to break down visibly.
The wood began to rot,
Decay sets in, showing how neglect leads to deterioration of institutions, culture, and shared values.
The viewer’s gaze is still on his watch,
Individuals remain directed on themselves, blind to the larger decline happening around them with focus still on themselves
Blind to the decay of the clock,
Society begins to break down, as self-interest replaces attention for the collective loss and the need for Order And attentiveness towards our society to flourish</p>
